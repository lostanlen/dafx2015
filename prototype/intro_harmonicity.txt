**Introduction**
The spectro-temporal evolution of harmonic spectra conveys essential information to audio classification, blind source separation, automated transcription, as well as other processing tasks. This information is however difficult to capture in time-varying, polyphonic mixtures. 
On one hand, spectrogram-based pattern recognition algorithms are exposed to detection errors as they impose strong constraints on the shape of harmonic templates. On the other, time-varying generalizations of matrix factorization ([Hennequin et al.]) are under-constrained and thus may fail to converge to a satisfying solution.
In this article, we address the problem of capturing time-frequency harmonic structures without having to track individual partials nor detect harmonic templates.
The biggest challenge in 

The harmonic comb is made of isolated peaks along the log-frequency axis of constant-Q filters.


To recover regularity across partials, we capitalize on the fact that power-of-two harmonics are distant from exactly one octave. By rolling up the log-frequency axis in a spiral, such that octave intervals correspond to full turns, these partials get aligned on a radius. Consequently, introducing the integer-valued octave variable reveals harmonic regularity that was not explicit in the plane of time and log-frequency.

Once specified the variables of time, log-frequency, and octave index, our transform merely consists in cascading three wavelet decompositions along them and applying complex modulus. Section 2 gives a formal definition of the spiral wavelet transform. Section 3 introduces a nonstationary formulation of the source-filter model relying on time warps, and shows that its variabilities in pitch and spectral envelope are jointly linearized by the spiral scattering transform.
Section 4 provides a visual interpretation of the spiral wavelet coefficients in a music signal with extended instrumental techniques.
