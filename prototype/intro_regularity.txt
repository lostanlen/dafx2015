**Introduction**
Understanding the natural regularities in audio signals is essential to the design of a useful representation for classification, blind source separation, automated transcription, as well as other processing tasks. It is well known that a wavelet decomposition followed by complex modulus brings short-term regularity along the time axis, as it locally replaces oscillatory components by their envelopes. After this operation, longer-term regularities appear. In this article, we show that the same "wavelets-and-modulus" scheme can be applied to encompass them.

Local continuity in frequency modulation cause a slow rigid motion along the log-frequency axis. More globally, harmonic sounds exhibit a comb-like spectrum, which conveys the evolution of the spectral envelope. This comb looks highly irregular in log-frequency : unlike frequency modulation, it cannot be captured efficiently with two-dimensional wavelets. 

To recover regularity across partials, we capitalize on the fact that power-of-two harmonics are distant from exactly one octave. By rolling up the log-frequency axis in a spiral, such that octave intervals correspond to full turns, these partials get aligned on a radius. Consequently, introducing the integer-valued octave variable reveals harmonic regularity that was not explicit in the plane of time and log-frequency.

Once specified the variables of time, log-frequency, and octave index, our transform merely consists in cascading three wavelet decompositions along them and applying complex modulus. Section 2 gives a formal definition of the spiral wavelet transform. Section 3 introduces a nonstationary formulation of the source-filter model relying on time warps, and shows that its variabilities in pitch and spectral envelope are jointly linearized by the spiral scattering transform.
Section 4 provides a visual interpretation of the spiral wavelet coefficients in a music signal with extended instrumental techniques.
