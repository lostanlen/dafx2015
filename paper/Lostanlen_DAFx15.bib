@article{Hennequin2011,
abstract = {Real-world sounds often exhibit time-varying spectral shapes, as observed in the spectrogram of a harpsichord tone or that of a transition between two pronounced vowels. Whereas the standard non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) assumes fixed spectral atoms, an extension is proposed where the temporal activations (coefficients of the decomposition on the spectral atom basis) become frequency dependent and follow a time-varying autoregressive moving average (ARMA) modeling. This extension can thus be interpreted with the help of a source/filter paradigm and is referred to as source/filter factorization. This factorization leads to an efficient single-atom decomposition for a single audio event with strong spectral variation (but with constant pitch). The new algorithm is tested on real audio data and shows promising results.},

@article{Anden2014DSS,
abstract = {A scattering transform defines a locally translation invariant representation which is stable to time-warping deformations. It extends MFCC representations by computing modulation spectrum coefficients of multiple orders, through cascades of wavelet convolutions and modulus operators. Second-order scattering coefficients characterize transient phenomena such as attacks and amplitude modulation. A frequency transposition invariant representation is obtained by applying a scattering transform along log-frequency. State-the-of-art classification results are obtained for musical genre and phone classification on GTZAN and TIMIT databases, respectively.},

@article{Deutsch2008,
abstract = {This paper describes an algorithm for producing pitch circularity using tones that each comprise a full harmonic series, and reports an experiment that demonstrates such circularity. Banks of 12 tones (i.e., scales) were created, with F0 varying in semitone steps. For each scale, as F0 descended, the amplitudes of the odd-numbered harmonics were reduced relative to the even-numbered ones by 3.5 dB for each semitone step. In consequence, the tone with the lowest F0 was heard as though displaced up an octave. In an experiment employing two such scales, all possible ordered tone pairs from each scale were presented, making 132 ordered tone pairs for each scale. Sixteen subjects judged for each tone pair whether the second tone was higher or lower than the first. The data derived from these pairwise comparisons were subjected to Kruskal's nonmetric multidimensional scaling, and excellent circularities were obtained. Individual differences in the subjects' judgments were also explored. The findings support the argument that musical pitch should be characterized as varying along two dimensions: the monotonic dimension of pitch height and the circular dimension of pitch class.},

@article{Shepard1964,
abstract = {A special set of computer-generated complex tones is shown to lead to a complete breakdown of transitivity in judgments of relative pitch. Indeed, the tones can be represented as equally spaced points around a circle in such a way that the clockwise neighbor of each tone is judged higher in pitch while the counter-clockwise neighbor is judged lower in pitch. Diametrically opposed tones -- though clearly different in pitch--are quite ambiguous as to the direction of the difference.The results demonstrate the operation of a "proximity principle "for the continuum of frequency and suggest that perceived pitch cannot be adequately represented by a purely rectilinear scale.},
