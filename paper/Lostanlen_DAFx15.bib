abstract = {We present a system for adaptive spectral basis decompo- sition that learns to identify independent spectral features given a sequence of short-term Fourier spectra. When ap- plied to recordings of polyphonic piano music, the indi- vidual notes are identified as salient features, and hence each short-term spectrum is decomposed into a sum of note spectra; the resulting encoding can be used as a ba- sis for polyphonic transcription. The system is based on a probabilistic model equivalent to a form of noisy inde- pendent component analysis (ICA) or sparse coding with non-negativity constraints. We introduce a novel mod- ification to this model that recognises that a short-term Fourier spectrum can be thought of as a noisy realisation of the power spectral density of an underlying Gaussian process, where the noise is essentially multiplicative and non-Gaussian. Results are presented for an analysis of a live recording of polyphonic piano music.},

@inproceedings{Smaragdis2003,
abstract = { We present a methodology for analyzing polyphonic musical passages comprised of notes that exhibit a harmonically fixed spectral profile (such as piano notes). Taking advantage of this unique note structure, we can model the audio content of the musical passage by a linear basis transform and use non-negative matrix decomposition methods to estimate the spectral profile and the temporal information of every note. This approach results in a very simple and compact system that is not knowledge-based, but rather learns notes by observation.},

abstract = {Real-world sounds often exhibit time-varying spectral shapes, as observed in the spectrogram of a harpsichord tone or that of a transition between two pronounced vowels. Whereas the standard non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) assumes fixed spectral atoms, an extension is proposed where the temporal activations (coefficients of the decomposition on the spectral atom basis) become frequency dependent and follow a time-varying autoregressive moving average (ARMA) modeling. This extension can thus be interpreted with the help of a source/filter paradigm and is referred to as source/filter factorization. This factorization leads to an efficient single-atom decomposition for a single audio event with strong spectral variation (but with constant pitch). The new algorithm is tested on real audio data and shows promising results.},

abstract = {A scattering transform defines a locally translation invariant representation which is stable to time-warping deformations. It extends MFCC representations by computing modulation spectrum coefficients of multiple orders, through cascades of wavelet convolutions and modulus operators. Second-order scattering coefficients characterize transient phenomena such as attacks and amplitude modulation. A frequency transposition invariant representation is obtained by applying a scattering transform along log-frequency. State-the-of-art classification results are obtained for musical genre and phone classification on GTZAN and TIMIT databases, respectively.},

@misc{Shepard1964,
abstract = {A special set of computer-generated complex tones is shown to lead to a complete breakdown of transitivity in judgments of relative pitch. Indeed, the tones can be represented as equally spaced points around a circle in such a way that the clockwise neighbor of each tone is judged higher in pitch while the counter-clockwise neighbor is judged lower in pitch. Diametrically opposed tones -- though clearly different in pitch--are quite ambiguous as to the direction of the difference.The results demonstrate the operation of a "proximity principle "for the continuum of frequency and suggest that perceived pitch cannot be adequately represented by a purely rectilinear scale.},
