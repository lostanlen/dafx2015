\section{Introduction}
Spectrogram-based pattern recognition algorithms, such as sparse coding [Abdallah Plumbley 2005] and Nonnegative Matrix Factorization [Smaragdis Brown 2003], are widespread in audio signal processing.
They are designed to approximate their input by a linear combination of few data-driven templates.
Musical chords, for example, are expected to get decomposed into individual notes.

However, most natural sounds cannot be factorized as amplitude-modulated fixed spectra: notably, continuous changes in pitch (e.g. vibrato, glissando) as well as in spectral envelope (e.g. attack transients, formantic transitions) have a joint time-frequency structure that cannot be matched to a single spectral atom.
Time-varying, under-constrained generalizations have been devised to address this shortcoming [Hennequin et al. 2011], but their high number of parameters prevents their robustness in challenging polyphonic contexts.

Instead of specifying probabilistic priors to help the convergence [Fuentes et al. 2013], we aim to design a template-free, nonlinear, mid-level representation, that natively disentangles the time variabilities of pitch and spectral envelope.

The central idea to our representation is that the former correspond to rigid motions along the log-frequency axis, whereas the latter affect the relative amplitude of harmonics across neighboring octaves.
This distinction can be conceptually emphasized by arranging the log-frequency axis in a spiral, hence aligning frequency bins that share the same musical pitch class or "chroma" [Shepard 1964].
By means of a multivariable wavelet transform (see Fig. \ref{fig:spiral-wavelets}), which consists of joint time-chroma-octave convolutions, changes in pitch and spectral envelope are respectively captured as angular and radial motions on the spiral.

The contributions of this paper are:
\begin{itemize}
\item
the introduction of the Shepard spiral scattering transform as a cascade of wavelet operators,
\item
a nonstationary formulation of the source-filter convolutional model relying on time warps, and its factorization in the wavelet scalogram,
\item
an approximate closed-form expression of Shepard spiral scattering coefficients, showing that variabilities in pitch and spectral envelope get jointly linearized, and stably appear as energy maxima.
\item
a visualization of these coefficients in Berio's \emph{Sequenza V}, revealing extended instrumental techniques.
\end{itemize}

\section{Shepard spiral scattering}

Let $\psi(t)=\vert\psi\vert(t)\mathrm{e}^{2\pi\mathrm{i}t}$ a "mother wavelet" of dimensionless center frequency $1$ and bandwidth $Q^{-1}$.
The quality factor $Q$ is an integer in the typical range $12$\textendash$24$.
Center frequencies of the subsequent wavelet filter bank are of the
form $\lambda_{1} = 2^{j_{1} + \frac{\chi_{1}}{Q}}$, where the indices
$j_{1} \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $\chi_1 \in \{1\ldots\,Q\}$ respectively denote
octave and chroma. The Fourier transform $\widehat{\psi}(\omega)$ of $\psi(t)$ is dilated by resolutions $\lambda_1$ to obtain wavelets $\widehat{\psi_{\lambda_1}}$ in the frequency domain:

\[
\widehat{\psi_{\lambda_{1}}}(\omega)=\widehat{\psi}(\lambda^{-1}\omega)
\quad\mathrm{i.e.}\quad
\psi_{\lambda_{1}}(t)=\lambda_{1}\psi(\lambda_{1}t).
\]

The wavelet transform of an audio signal $x(t)$ is defined as the array of convolutions $x \ast \psi_{\lambda_1}(t)$ for every audible frequency $\lambda_1$. The modulus of the resulting signals, called \emph{scalogram}, localize the power spectrum of $x(t)$ around the log-frequencies $\log_2 \lambda_1 = j_1 + \frac{\chi_1}{Q}$ over durations $2 Q \lambda_1^{-1}$, trading frequency resolution for time resolution:

\[
x_1 (t, \log_{2}\lambda_{1}) = \left| x \ast \psi_{\lambda_{1}} \right| (t).
\]

The constant-Q transform (CQT) $S_1 x$ corresponds to a lowpass filtering of $x_1$ with a window $\phi(t)$ of size $T$.

\[
S_1 x (t, \log_2 \lambda_1) = x_1 \ast \phi_T (t) = \left| x \ast \psi_{\lambda_{1}} \right| \ast \phi_T (t).
\]

There is a well-known dilemma in choosing $T$. Too small, the constant-Q matrix lacks invariance to time shifts, which will prevent any learning step to generalize from $S_1 x$ ; too large, discriminative information is discarded.

In order to combine the best of both worlds, the scattering transform recovers finer time scales than $T$ with a second filterbank of wavelets $\psi_{\lambda_2}(t)$ of center frequencies $\lambda_2$, and applies complex modulus to improve regularity [Andén Mallat 2011].

\[
x_2 (t, \log_2 \lambda_1, \log_2 \lambda_2) =
\left| \left| x \ast \psi_{\lambda_{1}} \right|  \ast \psi_{\lambda_{2}} \right| (t) 
\]

Also known as \emph{amplitude modulation spectrum} [Thompson Atlas 2003], the three-way array $x_2$ is then averaged in time to achieve as much invariance as the constant-Q spectrum $S_1 x$:

\[
S_2 x (t, \log_2 \lambda_1, \log_2 \lambda_2) =
\left| \left| x \ast \psi_{\lambda_{1}} \right|  \ast \psi_{\lambda_{2}} \right| (t)  \ast \phi_T (t).
\]

The concatenated scattering representation $Sx = \{S_1 x, S_2 x \}$ has proven to achieve higher accuracy in music genre classification as well as phoneme recognition [Andén et Malla 2011] than audio features derived from $S_1 x$ only, such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC).

It should be noted that, while the definition above successfully describes the average spectral envelope and amplitude modulation of a signal, it decomposes and averages each frequency band separately. Hence, it cannot properly characterize the joint time-frequency structure of natural sounds.

Cepstral coefficients, which pictures pitch on a line, does not involve pitch circularity. Conversely, chroma features are insensible to octave transpositions.

\[
\log_2 \lambda_1 = \lfloor \log_2 \lambda_1 \rfloor + \{ \log_2 \lambda_1 \}
\]

\[
\Psi_{\lambda_2}(t, \log_2 \lambda_1) =
\psi_{\alpha}(t) \times
\psi_{\beta}(\log_2 \lambda_1) \times
\psi_{\gamma}(\lfloor \log_2 \lambda_1 \rfloor)
\]

The integer part $\lfloor \log_2 \lambda_1 \rfloor$ is the octave index (related to perceived pitch height), whereas the fractional part $\{ \log_2 \lambda_1 \}$ is related to pitch chroma.

\section{Deformations of the source-filter model}



\section{Conclusions}

Future work will be devoted to evaluating the discriminative power of Shepard spiral scattering coefficients over a variety of classification pipelines. Our representation also encompass automatic music transcription, perceptual similarity learning, and new audio transformations as potential applications.
